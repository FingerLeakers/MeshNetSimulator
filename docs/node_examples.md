# Simple mesh examples

A small collection of algorithms that runs on graphs and can aid to find new routing schemes.
The examples can be run by replacing (node.js)[src/node.js] with the content of the linked files below:


* [Max number consensus](src/node_max_num_consensus.js)
* [Distance enumeration](src/node_distance_enumeration.js)
