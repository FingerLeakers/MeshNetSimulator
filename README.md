# Mesh Network Routing Algorithm Simulator

This is a simple simulator for sketching mesh network routing strategies in the hopes to find better approaches to mesh routing. Please note that this simulator does not virtualize a TCP/IP stack nor all characteristics of wireless connections. The dynamic nature of MANETs is also not (yet) covered by this simulator.

The simulator is controled via a command line that can also be reached over a network. The output from the simulator is a json files and can be displayed using the [Graph Viewer](https://github.com/mwarning/GraphViewer/).

The motivation for this project is that community networks such as [Freifunk](https://freifunk.net) struggle with scaling issues of their [MANET](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobile_ad_hoc_network)s. The cause is management traffic caused by hundreds of nodes.

Also part of this repository are [basic information](docs/about_mesh_networking.md) about mesh routing protocols.

Note: The project was formally written in JavaScript. Use the commit history if you want to look at that version.

## Visualization

The graph can be inspected e.g. by using [GraphViewer](https://github.com/mwarning/GraphViewer).

## Command Line

Some commands on the command line are:

- `step [<steps>]`  
   Perform simulation steps.
- `test`  
   Check the routing success, this does not change the state of any nodes/links. Nodes are written to a JSON file after each invocation.
- `stat`: Display statistics.
- `add_line <number of nodes> <make loop>`  
   Create a line of nodes.
- `add_lattice4 <x count> <y count>`  
   Add a common lattice structure.
- `add_tree <number of nodes> <cross links>`  
   Add a random tree structure with some number of additional cross links between the branches.
- `algorithm [<algorithm>]`  
   Get or set routing algorithm (e.g. `random`, `vivaldi`)
- `import <file>`  
   Import a network from a JSON file.
- `export <file>`  
   Export the network structure to a JSON file.
