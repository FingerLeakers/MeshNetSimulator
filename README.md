# MeshNetSimulator

Community networks such as [Freifunk](https://freifunk.net) struggle with scaling issues and data overhead beyond a few hundred nodes.

This is a simple simulator for exploring/sketching mesh network routing strategies in the hopes to find better approaches.
The code is written in plain JavaScript/HTML using the [d3](https://d3js.org) visualization library.

Pull requests are welcome!

Features:
- load, edit and store Meshviewer nodes.json/graph.json data
- create custom (bidirectional) graphs from primitives
- live editing of [Node](src/node.js), [Link](src/link.js) and [Packet](src/packet.js) implementations
- run simulations

Available are [basic information](docs/about_mesh_networking.md) about mesh routing and a collection of [examples](docs/node_examples.md).

## FAQ

* **Why JavaScript?**  
  Because of d3.js for visualisation. Also, JavaScript is simple enough for sketching ideas.

* **How fast is the simulation?**  
  10000 steps for a lattice of 10000 nodes and 19800 links with ~36000 packets takes about three minutes on a i7.

* **How is the routing efficiency value calculated?**  
  Overall efficiency is computed as the medium efficiency of each route. Route efficiency is calculated as (`optimal route hop count` * `number of received packets` / `accumulated hop count of received packets`).

## How to Use

### Start

Get the content of the repository and open the file index.html in a browser.

### Create a topology

Create some network using the `Edit` tab and click on the `lattice` button to create a 3x3 lattice.
You can also load meshviewer nodes.json/graph.json data files (e.g. [nodes.json](https://regensburg.freifunk.net/data/nodes.json)/[graph.json](https://regensburg.freifunk.net/data/graph.json)).

### Implement a routing strategy (optional)

A simple routing algorithm is already implemented. It will discovery neighbors and route packets to random neighbors.
For sketching your own mesh routing strategy, you need to edit the node.js and packet.js files.

### Deploy packets
Select a start and end node for a route to deploy packets on. Keep the control key pressed to select multiple nodes.
Click the `Add Routes` button on the `Sim` tab to create a route on which packets can be deployed.

### Simulate

Click the `step` button two times to let the nodes discover its neighbors with special broadcast packets.
Now to click the `Deploy Packets` button once to place packets on the created routes.
The number of (unicast) packets will be displayed on the node.
Use the `step` button to let the nodes propagate through the network in a random fashion until the destination is reached.

### Evaluate (optional)

The `Sim` tab will show the efficiency of the routing approach once a packet has reached its destination.
Use the `show` tab to inspect the state of selected nodes and its current packets.
