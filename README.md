# MeshNetSimulator

Community networks such as [Freifunk](https://freifunk.net) struggle with scaling issues and data overhead beyond a few hundred nodes.

This is a simple simulator for exploring/sketching mesh network routing strategies in the hopes to find better approaches.
The code is written in plain JavaScript/HTML using [d3](https://d3js.org).

Pull requests are welcome!

Features:
- load MeshViewer nodes.json/graph.json data
- create and edit graphs
- run simple simulations

TODO:
- fix animation toggle
- bandwidth link property is not handled
- multiple packets on a links need to increase packet loss
- network saving not yet implemented yet

Format Documentation:
- [MeshViewer](https://github.com/ffrgb/meshviewer)
- [NetJSON](http://netjson.org/rfc.html#rfc.section.5) (not supported yet)

## How to Use

### Start

Get the content of the repository and open the file index.html in a browser.

### Create a topology

Either load nodes.json/graph.json (e.g. [nodes](https://regensburg.freifunk.net/data/nodes.json)/[graph](https://regensburg.freifunk.net/data/graph.json)) or create some network using the `Edit` tab.

### Implement a routing strategy (optional)

For sketching a mesh routing strategy, you need to edit the node.js and packet.js files.
Both files can be reloaded using the interface.
A simple neighbor discovery and random neighbor routing algorithm is already implemented.

### Deploy packets
Deploy packets manually or add defined routes to deploy continuous packets on each simulation step. The number of steps the packets need to arrive at the destination node will be used to calculate an overall efficiency value.

### Simulate

Click the sim button to let the nodes forward the packets to neighbors.
